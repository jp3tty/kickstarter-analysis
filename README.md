# Module 1: An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Analysis and Challenges
Kickstarter data was reviewed and analyzed to aid in desiding the best time of year to begin a campaign for a play production in the United States.

The data was conditionally formatted to quickly reference which campaigns were successful, canceled, failed, or live. Further analysis was performed to understand what percentage each campaign were funded and a graded condition was applied over this to visually show the extremes.

The data was further evaluated by generating subcategories from the Parent categories, rendering Kickstarter campaigns for theater. The parent category was charted to reference to optimal month to launch kickstarter campaigns.
